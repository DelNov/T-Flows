# T-Flows - Fortran 90 CFD cell-centered 2-nd order accuracy code to simulate incompressible fluids.

Code has 4 sub-programs at the moment and uses meshes in internal .geo format.
Generate - to generate mesh from ASCII .dom to .geo.
Convert - to convert mesh from .neu, .cgns format to .geo.
Divide - to divide .geo in pieces.
Process - to solve discretized Navier-Stokes equations.

Build depends on:
ld, make, gfortran, git and mpi (only for parallel execution).

Build tested on:
ld >= 2.24
gfortran >= 4.8
mpich >= 3.0.4
openmpi >= 1.6.5
make >= 3.81
git >= 1.91
