T-Flows (stands for Turbulent Flows) - Fortran 90 CFD cell-centered 2-nd order accuracy code to simulate incompressible fluids via discretized Navier-Stokes equations.

At the moment a few URANS models were implemented:
k-eps, zeta-f, Reynolds stress Manceau-Hanjalic and Jakirlic-Hanjalic models
LES method uses dynamic subgrid scale Smagorinsky model,
and DNS, Hybrid URANS/LES methods.

Code has four sub-programs at the moment and uses own proprietary format for computational grids (.geo, .cns).
Generate - to generate mesh from ASCII .dom to own format.
Convert - to convert mesh from .neu, .cgns to own format.
Divide - to divide mesh to pieces.
Process - to solve discretized Navier-Stokes equations.

Build depends on:
ld, make, gfortran, git and mpi (only for parallel execution).

Build tested on:
ld >= 2.24
gfortran >= 4.8
mpich >= 3.0.4
openmpi >= 1.6.5
make >= 3.81
git >= 1.91

To download current version of the code use:
git clone https://github.com/DelNov/T-Flows/

Compiled programs are in Binaries/ folder.
Sources are in Sources/Generate/, Sources/Convert/, Sources/Divide/, Sources/Process/ .

Tests/ folder contains a few cases for RANS, LES and Hybrid methods.
