This folder contains files needed to run LES simulation of channel
flow with heat transfer. Turbulent Re number is 590 and domain is 
2h x pi*h x h (x, y and z dir), where h is height of channel. Mesh
is generated by T-FlowS mesh generator. Folder contains solution from
lower Re number channel flow (Re_tau = 180) that can be interpolated
on new mesh so no perturbation is needed. Prior to simulation 
interpolate_on_new_mesh.f90 (located in Utilities) has to be compiled
as double precision and executed in order to generate input files 
with extension .init. Perturbation
of velocity in this case is not desirable since it takes a lot of time
to dissipate extra energy that is bring into system by perturbation
(visible in unphysical non-zero mean value of span-wise velocity component).
Interpolation option has to be activated in T-FlowS.cmn by replacing 
skip with the case name (chan).
