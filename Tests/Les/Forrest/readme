Different tree shapes are defined in .obj and .mtl files:

  tree_forrest.mtl
  tree_forrest.obj
  tree_neutral.mtl
  tree_neutral.obj
  tree_urban.mtl
  tree_urban.obj

The .mtl files are not used by T-Flows, but are kept for the future, who knows.

Anyhow, these trees can be transformed to forrest with Convert, for example:

  ./Convert < convert_plant_trees.scr

will creates: tree_neutral.faces.vtu with planted trees.  Trees are planted
inside the STL file forrest.stl which is defined separatelly, with GMSH for
example.
