                                                                     24.06.2022

I set up this case to examine the sensitivity to SIMPLE tolerance for an
unsteady flow situation.  I chose a flow around a horizontal cylinder in a
channel at Re=100.  The case is described here (though I didn't read it yet):
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/fld.195

Anyhow, I wanted to run the case with a number of tolerance for momentum (M),
pressure (P) and simple algorithm (S).  The idea was to go in triplets such as:

momentum: 1.e-1; pressure: 1.e-1; simple: 1.e-1  (abbreviated as M1-P1-S1),
momentum: 1.e-2; pressure: 1.e-2; simple: 1.e-2  (abbreviated as M2-P2-S2),
....

but the first case (M1-P1-S1) soon showed that pressure (P) should be solved
for an order of magnitude tighter than momentum (M) and/or simple (S).  (Maybe
it is not one order of magnitude, maybe it is square, I don't know, but tighter
nonetheless.)

Hence, the final set of tests which were ran consisted of:

M1-P2-S1
M2-P3-S2
M3-P4-S3
M4-P5-S4
M5-P6-S5
M6-P7-S6

I didn't bother to compute drag and lift factorsi, but history of the vertical
velocity component was monitored for all the cases at position (1.1, 0.2, 0.2),
which is in the center of the computational domain, and following conclusions
were drawn:

- Cases M1-P2-S2 and M2-P3-S2 gave steady solutions, meaning such high
  tolerances should be avoided!
- The cases (M2-P3-S2, M3-P4-S3 and on) feature unsteady solution, but are
  very close to each other, really.
- The cases didn't reach an asymptotic behavior.  M3-.., M4-.. and M5-.. go
  in one direction, but the M6-.. goes back towards M4-..

All in all, it seems that minimum simple tolerance one should use is 1.e-3
and use a pressure tolerance which ensures this.  (In the above case, it was
an order of magnitude lower).

Two things miss in this analysis.  One is the tolerance to pressure gradient
calculation, and the other is Choi's correction to Rhie and Chow algorithm.

One should either try to to use least squares for gradients, or include
sensitivity to gradient tolerances into play as well.  One may argue what is
the point of squeezing tolerances for pressure to 1.e-7 if gradients are
computed to the accuracy of 1.e-3 anyway?

All the results and control files are in the sub-directory Re_100_A

                                                                     25.06.2022

I decided to address the issues raised above; that to include gradient
computation tolerance into game as well.  Following the nomenclature introduced
above, I will have the cases:

M1-P2-S1-G2
M2-P3-S2-G3
M3-P4-S3-G4
M4-P5-S4-G5
M5-P6-S5-G6
M6-P7-S6-G7

These simulations also monitor (new development in T-Flows) the number of Gauss
iterations needed to converge for gradients.  What I observe in these cases is
the following:

- Both cases M1-.. and M2-.. gave steady solutions and they needed (on the
  average) 2.013 and 2.651 iterations to compute pressure gradients.
- The cases which follow all sport proper vortex shedding behavior, with
  differences between results similar to the case describe above.
- For M3-.. the average number of iterations was 8.621; for M4-.. it was
  11.738 and for other cases 13.
- The results for unsteady cases all go towards one direction with lowering
  tolerances, but don't feature an asymptotic behaviour.

I would conclude, at this point, that nothing makes sense without Choi's
correction to unsteady terms.  It simply doesn't seem to make sense to spend
time squeezing unsteady solution without Choi.

All the results and control files are in the sub-directory Re_100_B

                                                                     26.06.2022

All the same as above, but with Choi correction included.  The correction by
Choi had a stronger impact on results than I expected.  First of all, the
case M2-P3-S2-G3 gave unsteady results for the first time!  That was quite
surprising.  Second, the results differ a lot from one another, much more than
any of the results above in Re_100_A and Re_100_B.  Finally, and the most
importantly, the results are showing asymptotic behaviour, I reckon because
we finally have the complete and correct numerical model with correction from
Choi.  I would say that the cases above should be discarded since they were
done without Choi's correction.

All the results are in the sub-directory Re_100_C

From this point on, tolerances for gradients should be re-visited, maybe they
are not so important.

                                                                     27.02.2022

The directory Re_100_D contains varying tolerances for SIMPLE, but gradient
tolerances kept at one value only, that of 1.0e-3.  The results were almost
the same as in Re_100_C, meaning that gradient tolerances don't have a hell of
an importance after all.

So, all in all, one could conclude:

1. For accuracy of time-integration, Choi's correction is essential
2. SIMPLE tolerances should be less than 1.0e-4, though one may still get
   somewhere with 1.0e-3.
3. Pressure tolerances should be chosen in such a way to bring the SIMPLE
   tolerances down enough.  In this case, it proved to be one order of
   magnitude less.
4. It doesn't make sense to squeeze Gauss gradient calculation down too much.
   The default 1.0-3 seems reasonable enough.
