I set up this case in GMSH withouth much thinking, expecting it not to work and
expecting to start looking for a reaason why it didn't work.  Surprisingly, the
case was running "out of the box".

When converting the mesh to T-Flows format, I chose the orthogonal placement
of boundary cells, believing I would use least squares for gradients.  I later
checked: the case also works for barycentric placement, but doesn't converge as
well and gives slighltly different results.

The case fails when velocities are computed with Gaussian gradients, but if
pressure gradients only are computed with Gaussian method, it works OK.

The branch on which it was running was "has_pressure" and cross diffusion terms
for pressure were not included, not yet at least.
