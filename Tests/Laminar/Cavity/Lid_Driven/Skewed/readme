This case was set up to test if cross-diffusion for pressure makes a big impact
on results, and it shows that it doesn's.  Also, the skewness was much more of
an issue in the age of block-structured grids, no need to spend a lot of time
on this.

So, maybe there is no point in bothering in solving many cases (different
angles, lid-driven, thermally-driven or what have you), and instead only solve
45 degrees domain, lid-driven at Re=1000.

One good thing which came out of this example are the Paraview scripts to
extract profiles from a domain.
