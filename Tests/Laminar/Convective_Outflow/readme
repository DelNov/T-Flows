convective.geo is the default geometry, flow aligned with x coordinate.

convective_rot_z.geo is geometry rotated by 30 degrees in the z plane to
test the implementation of coordinate invariant Convective_Outflow.  If
rotated geometry is used, one should also use the enclosed User Function
for setting bulk velocity to 1.0.
