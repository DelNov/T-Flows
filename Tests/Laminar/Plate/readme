Case which demonstrates how infitintelly thin plate can be used in simulations.

The directory contains two cases:

with_plate

without_plate

The computational domain is the same in both cases except that one is with
and one withut plate (names clearly say which is which)

Pointwise glyph scripts are included for both cases, so that one can see
what is the difference between them.  Important to note is that plate, when
present, has to be defined for both blocks around it.
