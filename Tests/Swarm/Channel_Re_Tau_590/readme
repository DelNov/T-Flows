Phase 1:

Start with flow development, i.e. use the control file:
control_a_flow_development.

This phase will also gather some statistics.  In addition to results in VTU
format, you will have space-averaged turbulence statistics in:
chan-res-plus-ts024000.dat and chan-res-ts024000.dat

Phase 2:

Use the control file control_b_with_particles to compute flow with particles,
gather particle statistics and another flow statistics.
