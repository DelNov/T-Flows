Phase 1:

Start with flow development, i.e. use the control file:
control_a_flow_development.

This phase will also gather some statistics.  In addition to results in VTU
format, you will have space-averaged turbulence statistics in:
chan-res-plus-ts024000.dat and chan-res-ts024000.dat

Phase 2:

Use the control file control_b_with_particles to compute flow with particles,
gather particle statistics and another flow statistics.

# --------------------------------- #
# Running the case use bash scripts
# --------------------------------- #
1- submit the first bash script for advecting the fluid flow by typing: sh runCaseFluid.sh
2- Once the flow is fully developed and the first simulation is over, start advancing particles
   by running: sh runCaseParticles.sh
