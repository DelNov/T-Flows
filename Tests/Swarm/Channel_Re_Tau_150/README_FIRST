Phase 1:
--------

Start with flow development, i.e. use the control file:
control_a_flow_development.

>> In case you were interested in turbulent statistics: 
This phase will also gather some statistics.  In addition to results in VTU
format, you will have space-averaged turbulence statistics in:
chan-res-plus-ts024000.dat and chan-res-ts024000.dat

Phase 2:
--------

Use the control file control_b_with_particles to compute flow with particles,
gather particle statistics and another flow statistics.

# --------------------------------- #
# Running the case use bash scripts #
# --------------------------------- #
1- sh runCase.sh fluid serial (or parallel)      > developing the continuous fluid phase. 
2- sh runCase.sh particle serial (or parallel)   > advecting the dispersed phase.
