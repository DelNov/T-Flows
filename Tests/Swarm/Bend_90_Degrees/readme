The computation of this case goes in two stages: flow development and particle
tracking.  That is, particle tracking starts only when the flow is fully
developed.  For each of these stages, two sets of control files are present
and they reside in directories:
- Control_Flow_Development
- Control_Particle_Tracking

For the latter, the control.2 contains a list of particle diameters needed to
conduct the full benchmark.  You should uncomment the diameter for which you
want to run the particle tracking simulation.
