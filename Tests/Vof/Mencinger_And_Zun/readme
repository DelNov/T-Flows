OK, this case is a bit clinical and won't work without a few interventions
in the sources.  Those changes are:

In Main_Pro.f90
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Movement of front should be disabled.  Therefore, in Main_Pro.f90 all
   lines of code related to VOF simulation should be commented.  In revision
   e7952ac1deee775d18c188810edc6bc1d325ae19 these lines are: 284-293

In Compute_Momentum.f90
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2. Compute_Momentum, disable the lines which take into account
   cross diffusion at the faces and stresses at the faces.  In revision
   a5732cae1bb28e327a006e0355bf3098a58d701a, these lines will read:

    ! Explicit treatment for cross diffusion terms
    ! do c = 1, grid % n_cells
    !   fi(c) = fi(c) + ui % c(c)
    ! end do

   and are in lines: 262-265

3. Set lines 234-235 in Compute_Momentum.f90 (same revision as above) to:

      m12 = m0 ! - min(v_flux % n(s), 0.0) * flow % density(c1)
      m21 = m0 ! + max(v_flux % n(s), 0.0) * flow % density(c2)

   that is, comment the contribution of fluxes to system matrix.

In Compute_Pressure.f90
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4. In Compute_Pressure.f90, revision e7952ac1deee775d18c188810edc6bc1d325ae19,
   comment the lines 172-174:

   ! if(mult % model .eq. VOLUME_OF_FLUID) then
   !   call Multiphase_Mod_Vof_Pressure_Correction(mult, sol)
   ! end if

In Rhie_And_Chow.f90
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5. Something of this sort:

    ! FOR COMPARING WITH OCTAVE SCRIPT
    IF(MATH_MOD_APPROX_REAL(GRID % YF(S), 0.0) .AND.  &
       MATH_MOD_APPROX_REAL(GRID % ZF(S), 0.0)) THEN
      PRINT '(99ES17.7)', U_F(S),                                     &
                          (P % N(C2) - P % N(C1)),                    &
                          A12 / A % FC(S),                            &
                          A12 / A % FC(S) * (P % N(C2) - P % N(C1)),  &
                          A % FC(S) * (PX_F + PY_F + PZ_F),           &
                          P % X(C1), P % X(C2)
    END IF

   in Rhie_And_Chow could be useful for comparing results with Octave.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A little analysis (sumarized in graphs 01..04*.agr shows that Majundar method
is NOT needed if original entries from momentum matrix are used to form the
pressure matrix.  And the other way around, if the pressure matrix is formed
from under-relaxed momentum matrix, Majundar method is needed!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have also implemented Choi's method and seems to be working fine (not as
impressive as Majumdar, but works) and comparison with and without it can be
seen in graphs 05..06*.agr.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update on August 12, 2021.  It seems that only intervention in Main_Pro.f90
is needed to make this case work.  In current revision 
d276f4a7c87cebf6c43696e074b7b50643355ccc it is in lines: 283-288.
