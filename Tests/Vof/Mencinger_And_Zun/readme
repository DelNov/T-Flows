OK, this case is a bit clinical and won't work without a few interventions
in the sources.  Those changes are:

1. Movement of front should be disabled.  Therefore, in Main_Pro.f90 all
   lines of code related to VOF simulation should be commented.  In revision
   e83283b8d0956c5793fcd272bb39b83c9c406613 these lines are: 282-291

2. Add these five lines:

    if(mult % model .eq. VOLUME_OF_FLUID) then
      do c = 1, grid % n_cells
        cell_fi(c) = grid % vol(c) * flow % density(c) * grav_i
      end do
    end if

   in Compute_Momentum, soon after taking aliases.  In Compute_Momentum's
   revision 7bd74ec45277c64635dd890bb1866d2aa0534596, these lines are: 167-171

3. Still in Compute_Momentum, disable the lines which take into account
   cross diffusion at the faces and stresses at the faces.  In revision
   7bd74ec45277c64635dd890bb1866d2aa0534596, these lines will read:

    ! Explicit treatment for cross diffusion terms
    ! do c = 1, grid % n_cells
    !   fi(c) = fi(c) + ui % c(c)
    ! end do

   and are in lines: 279-281

4. Set lines 250-251 in Compute_Momentum.f90 (same revision as above) to:

      m12 = m0 ! - min(v_flux % n(s), 0.0) * flow % density(c1)
      m21 = m0 ! + max(v_flux % n(s), 0.0) * flow % density(c2)

   that is, comment the contribution of fluxes to system matrix.

5. Still in Compute_Momentum, same revision as before, comment the lines
   336-338, and uncomment: 394-396.  This is to form pressure matrix entries
   with under-relaxed momentum matrix.  (This is important only if you run
   Octave scritpst without option Pressure_Matrix_Default.)

6. In Compute_Pressure.f90, revision e7f6aeb691e085e66ced639113a487a5ef31eabb,
   comment the lines 174-176:

   ! if(mult % model .eq. VOLUME_OF_FLUID) then
   !   call Multiphase_Mod_Vof_Pressure_Correction(mult, sol)
   ! end if

7. Still in the Compute_Pressure, call Field_Mod_Grad_Pressure to compute
   pressure correction gradients instead od Field_Mod_Grad_Pressure_Correction,
   because the latter one allows iterative improvement of gradients close to
   the walls.

8. In Field_Mod/Grad_Pressure, increase the number of iterations of pressure
   gradients to meet those in Octave scripts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A little analysis (sumarized in graphs 01..04*.agr shows that Majundar method
is NOT needed if original entries from momentum matrix are used to form the
pressure matrix.  And the other way around, if the pressure matrix is formed
from under-relaxed momentum matrix, Majundar method is needed!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have also implemented Choi's method and seems to be working fine (not as
impressive as Majumdar, but works) and comparison with and without it can be
seen in graphs 05..06*.agr.
