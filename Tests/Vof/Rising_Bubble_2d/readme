This is one of the cases Mijail left behind.

It looks strange to me, the bubble resides on the floor in the beginning and
then rises up.  I am not sure if that's what he was really intending, but
here it is.

Another unpleasant fact is that the case works with grid generated from .dom
file, but fails from .geo file.  I believe it is because Convert doesn't treat
shadow faces in the same way Generate does, I better have a closer look into
that.  I think I know why, shadow faces are nor oriented properly in Convert,
but they are in Generate.  (December 11, 2022)
