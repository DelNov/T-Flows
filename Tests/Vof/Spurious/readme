Note that surface tension is stunning 15.0e+3, or 1.5e+4.

As Mijail sent it, Laplace number was:

     gamma * rho * L   15e+3 * 1.0 * 0.8
La = --------------- = ----------------- = 12000 = 1.2e+4
          mu^2                 1^2

Hence, if you fiddle with physical properties without care, Laplace number
can easily exceed 1e+5

Mijail also says that:

dt <= sqrt( (rho_L + rho_G) * min_vol/(8 * sigma))

So, for default grid we have:

min_vol     = (2.0/64)^3 = 3.0518e-5
sigma       = 15000
rho_L+rho_G = 2.0

dt < 2.255e-5
