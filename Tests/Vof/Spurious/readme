Note that surface tension is stunning 15.0e+3, or 1.5e+4.

As Mijail sent it, Laplace number was:

     gamma * rho * L   15e+3 * 1.0 * 0.8
La = --------------- = ----------------- = 12000 = 1.2e+4
          mu^2                 1^2

Hence, if you fiddle with physical properties without care, Laplace number
can easily exceed 1e+5

For air bubble in water, say bubble with 1 mm diameter, La would be:

     0.072 * 1000 * 0.001   0.072
La = -------------------- = ------ = 72000 = 7.2e+4
           0.001^2          1.0e+6

Mijail also says that:

dt <= sqrt( (rho_L + rho_G) * min_vol/(8 * sigma))

So, for default grid we have:

min_vol     = (2.0/64)^3 = 3.0518e-5
sigma       = 15000
rho_L+rho_G = 2.0

dt < 2.255e-5


There are xmgrace files with some histories of RMS of velocities.  These were
obtained in old days of initialization with user functions.  Since the
initialization has changed to STL, these have changed, and have changed for
worse - probably because initial VOF is not fully periodic in periodic
direction.  Still, can't keep those obsolete .ini files.
