This directory contains files needed to run computation of impinging jet
of Re = 23 000 and nozzle-to-plate distance 2D. The results are compared 
to experiments of Baughn and Shimizu 1989. 
In the folder you will find two scripts, one for mesh conversion from
gambit neu format to T-FlowS format, and another for  
spliting mesh into 2 sub-domains for parallel execution. Number of sub-domains
can be easily changed by editing the script.
