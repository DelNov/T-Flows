  This line is a comment too, just like any which doesn't start with a keyword.
  Keywords are written all in upper case and ARE case sensitive!
  It is a good idea to write comments in lower case only, to make sure program
  doesn't take them as keywords by mistake :D

Initial values

  Keep in mind it is enough to specify only those which are different from zero.


  INITIAL_CONDITION
    VARIABLES     u     uu      vv      ww      uv       eps     f22    
    VALUES        1.6   0.005   0.005   0.005   0.0001   0.001   0.01


Boundary conditions

  Like for initiali conditions, specify only those which are different from zero.
  If all are zero, feel free to ommit both variables and values

  BOUNDARY_CONDITION    outlet_face
    TYPE                pressure
    VARIABLES           u     v     w  
    VALUES              0.0   0.0   0.0

  BOUNDARY_CONDITION    lower_wall
    TYPE                wall

  BOUNDARY_CONDITION    upper_wall
    TYPE                symmetry

  For inlet, b.c. are specified in a file.  The list of variables given below must correspond
  to columns given in input file.  

  BOUNDARY_CONDITION    inlet_face
    TYPE                inflow
    VARIABLES           z     u     v     w     uu    vv    ww    uv    uw    vw    eps   f22    
    FILE                inflow_bc_rsm.dat
