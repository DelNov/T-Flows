  module Field_Mod
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
!>  The Field_Mod module is designed to manage various aspects of flow fields.
!>  It can handle both flow fields (like velocity and pressure) and scalar
!>  fields (such as temperature and scalars), making it applicable to a wide
!>  range of fluid flow problems.  The Field_Mod doesn't hold any variables
!>  describing turbulence characteristics (such as k, epsilon, zeta, f,
!>  statistical averages, ...) as these are stored in module Turb_Mod.
!>  Limited aspects of multiphase sitation are present in this module.

!     properties and scalar quantities, indicating its applicability in        !
!     thermal problems and scalar transport processes.                         !
!   * Numerical aspects: It includes some aspects related to numerical         !
!     methods, such as pressure-velocity coupling algorithms, gradient         !

!   * Utilities: The module contains utility procedures for gradient           !
!     calculation, buoyancy forces computation, Courant number calculation,    !
!     and more, which are essential for the accurate and efficient simulation  !
!     of fluid flows.                                                          !
