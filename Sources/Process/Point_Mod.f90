  module Point_Mod
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
!>  The Point_Mod module serves as the parent for all point-based modules in
!>  T-Flows, such as vertices and particles. It is distinct from numerical grid
!>  points (referred to as nodes) and is exclusively used within the Process
!>  sub-program. The module provides functionality to manage and interact with
!>  points in the computational domain, offering procedures to determine their
!>  nearest cells, nodes, and boundary cells.  A module with the same name
!>  exists in Generate, but that serves a different purpose from this one.
