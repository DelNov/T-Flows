  module Bulk_Mod
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
!>  The Bulk_Mod module in T-Flows' Process originated as a utility to maintain
!>  consistent volume flow rates and, associated with that, bulk velocities,
!>  and Reynolds numbers for LES studies of flows in channels and cube matrices.
!>  The module is not limited to these flows, and is effective for any flow
!>  with periodicity in the streamwise direction, providing a systematic
!>  approach to keep the desire volume flow rates or monitor flow rates as a
!>  function of pressure drops.  During a CFD simulation, Process even prints
!>  the current values of volume flow rates and pressure drops on the terminal.
