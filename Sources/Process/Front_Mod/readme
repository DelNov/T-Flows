This is simplified front tracking, similar to work by Juric.  It started out
as a copy of Surf_Mod, but will change with time, I am not sure how, yet.

It proved to be useful for phase change, to locate the interface, compute
temperature gradients taking satuarion temperature of the surface into
account and so forth.

In May 2021, it turned into a class ... meaning that Surf_Mod, which bears
manhy similarities with this module, could inherit the functions which are
the same.
