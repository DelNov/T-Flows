  module Var_Mod
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
!>  Module Var_Mod defines Var_Type which is, in turn, used to define all
!>  dependent variables in the T-Flows' solver Process.  Thus, individual
!>  velocity components, temperature, pressure and pressure corrections are all
!>  objects of Var_Type.  The Var_Type holds data fields to store its current
!>  value (n for new) old value (o for old) and older than old (oo) value.
!>  In addition, it also holds fields to store gradients of each dependent
!>  variable as well as many linear solver parameters, from the desired linear
!>  solver, tolerance levels required in linear solvers and even options passed
!>  to PETSc solvers.  Each variable holds its own instance of PETSc solver.

!   Comments on PETSc integration                                              !
!                                                                              !
!   Var_Mod features unique integration with PETSc object for each variable.   !
!   It maintains an individual PETSc instance (Pet) for optimized performance, !
!   particularly in preconditioning matrix formation and memory management.    !
!   * Advantages:                                                              !
!     - Efficiency: By allocating a dedicated PETSc instance for each          !
!       variable, the module potentially enhances computational efficiency,    !
!       especially in time-intensive operations like preconditioning.          !
!     - Flexibility: The module's design allows for detailed control over each !
!       variable's treatment within the solver, accommodating complex and      !
!       variable-specific requirements.                                        !
!   * Considerations:                                                          !
!     - Memory Usage: The unique PETSc instance per variable approach might    !
!      increase memory consumption, a trade-off for the expected gains in      !
!      computational efficiency.                                               !
!    - Complexity: Managing individual solvers and settings for each variable  !
!      adds complexity to the module, necessitating careful implementation and !
!      documentation.  Furthermore, there is asymmetry with the way in which   !
!      native solvers are treated, namely there is only one instance of them   !
!      in the whole program, as opposed to many PETSc instances.               !
