The extensions _iXX and rXX are for integer and real number precision.

So libmetis_i32_r64.a is for 32 bit integers and 64 bit reals and
libmetis_i32_r32.a is for 32 bit integers and 32 bit reals.  The
integers 64 bits long are not supported because they mess up calls
to MPI function significantly.  It ain't worth working around it.
