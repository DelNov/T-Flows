  module Comm_Mod
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
!>  The Comm_Mod module in T-Flows is a framework for managing Message Passing
!>  Interface (MPI) functionality in parallel computing environments.
!>  It provides an array of subroutines and types to facilitate effective
!>  communication, data exchange and syncronizations between processors.
!>  One of the important components are data members and procedure for handling
!>  parallel I/O, used extensivelly (and exclusivelly) to manage backup files.
!>  The module seamlessly integrates both parallel and sequential executions,
!>  ensuring adaptability across various computing environments.
!>  Additionally, it includes buffer and communicator types for efficient
!>  handling of distributed data and control over parallel processes.
