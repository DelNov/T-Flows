  module Grid_Mod
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
!>  The Grid_Mod module is a cornerstone in the T-Flows program, serving as the
!>  central repository for data structures and operations related to the
!>  computational grid. It is utilized across all sub-programs of T-Flows
!>  including Convert, Generate, Divide, and Process. This module's primary
!>  construct, Grid_Type, houses the necessary data for representing a
!>  computational grid and provides a comprehensive suite of methods for
!>  grid manipulation. These methods encompass a wide range of functionalities
!>  such as geometrical calculations, connectivity analysis, mesh division,
!>  and grid data export in various formats. The module's design emphasizes
!>  versatility and robustness, enabling efficient handling of diverse grid
!>  configurations and facilitating complex fluid dynamics simulations.
