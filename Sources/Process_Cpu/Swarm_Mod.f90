  module Swarm_Mod
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
!> The Swarm_Mod module is dedicated to Lagrangian particle tracking in
!> T-Flows. It manages swarms of particles, providing mechanisms for their
!> interaction with flow fields, turbulence modeling, and surface interactions.
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
! Features and Functionalities                                                 !
!                                                                              !
! * Particle integration: Manages the movement and interaction of particles    !
!   with the fluid and boundaries within a defined computational grid.         !
! * Turbulence interaction: Incorporates turbulence models like Brownian       !
!   motion (Fukagata) and Discrete Random Walk (DRW) for particle tracking.    !
! * Swarm dynamics: Handles the dynamic properties of particle swarms such     !
!   as density, diameter, relaxation time, and statistics.                     !
! * Particle-surface interactions: Manages particle behavior upon collision    !
!   with surfaces, including bouncing, trapping, and deposition.               !
! * Parallel processing: Supports particle exchange and tracking in parallel   !
!   computational environments, ensuring accurate swarm dynamics.              !
! * Statistical analysis: Provides functionality for calculating and           !
!   printing ensemble-averaged statistics of particle motion and interaction.  !
