Here are the vim syntax files for T-Flows.

Don't overlook the .vim sub-directory here!

If you want T-Flows, control file and .geo file syntax highlighting in
vim, link the .vim subdirectory from here to your home directory with
this:

ln -i -s $PWD/.vim/ $HOME/

or a similar command.  Important is that .vim from your $HOME points
to the .vim subdirectory here.
