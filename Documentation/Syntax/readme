Here are the vim syntax files for T-Flows.

Don't overlook the .vim sub-directory here!

If you want T-Flows, control file and .geo file syntax highlighting in
vim, link the .vim subdirectory from here to your home directory with
this:

ln -i -s $PWD/.vim/ $HOME/

or a similar command.  Important is that .vim from your $HOME points
to the .vim subdirectory here.


In order to fine-tune syntax with tflows_syntax.vim and gmsh_syntax.vim,
place these lines in your .vimrc:

"------------------
" Fine tune syntax
"------------------
" For T-Flows
source /home/niceno/tflows_syntax.vim
" For Gmsh
source /home/niceno/gmsh_syntax.vim
:set nonu                                                                                                                               54,1          Bot
